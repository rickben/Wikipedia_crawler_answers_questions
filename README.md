# Wikipedia_crawler_answers_questions
## Abstract
A crawler that goes through list of countries in the world and extracts information about them (name, president's name, population, etc.). Then allows to ask questions and answers them according to its database (in .nt format). Look in the added pdf for more information
run.

## How it works?
The questions should be in one of the 9 available formats:

  <img src="https://github.com/rickben/Wikipedia_crawler_answers_questions/blob/master/question2.jpg" width="400" />
</p>
You should follow the exact format in order to get the desired results. Only this type of answers wil be found in the data-base.

## Information extraction
The information was extracted from the wikipedia pages of each country found in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_population_(United_Nations).

  </p>
Note: It is possible that the wikipedia pages of some of the countries have changed, so it is possible that their will be no answer for those questions.
Nevertheless it is quite easy to fix the format in the code.

## How to use it?
You should write the following commands in the terminal:
The first command creates the data-base, so if you already ran it you don't have to use it again.
The second command runs the question in one of the 9 formats specified above.
